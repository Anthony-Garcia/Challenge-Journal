<h1>CREED Journal</h1>
            
<p>I believe that the leadership CREED is important because it helps us learn the fundamentals/expectations of the program in order to succeed and learn new skills. 
I believe that the mentors/coaches are expecting us to memorize the CREED so we won't step out of line and decide to disobey one of them, which can later on affect both the individual and potentially the whole group. The previous activities 
we did were pretty exciting (except for the push-ups) because it gave me the chance to collaborate with other members of the program. I also believe that these activities will later on help me and other members that are attending this TXT to 
build confidence amongst ourselves, which can potentially help us when doing group projects. </p>

  
 <h2>Personality Test Journal</h2>
     
<p>I think they were excellent because it showed me my strengths and weaknesses, as well as careers I can apply to in order to put those strengths to good and help me improve upon my weaknesses. The most surprising thing that I found out from 
taking the personality test is that it said I am suited for a career that involves entrepreneurship, which is one of my ultimate goals that I wanted to achieve. In order for me to reach my goal I have to join programs that help me excel (just like TXT)
both academically and mentally. What I mean about excelling academically is that I want to join something that teaches me new skills I can later on use in life/career. What I mean about excelling mentally is me being able to overcome my fears, which are speaking 
in front of a big crowd, by practicing and joining clubs that focus on speaking loudly (drama club). I believe it was pretty accurate because I do want a career that involves hands on experience, marketing, and entrepreneurship. However, I am a bit undecisive on the idea of 
me being able to speak in front of a large crowd because I don't have the courage to speak in front of people about a specific topic. What leadership means to me is having the courage and capacity to lead other people including yourself into the right direction.
